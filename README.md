# CV Resume

A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript CV with a flashlight effect.

## What it is

This is my personal CV made as a web page instead of a PDF. It has my skills, work experience, education, and projects listed out.

## Features

- **Flashlight effect** - Click the button to enable a dark mode with a circle of light that follows your mouse
- **Accordion sections** - Click on project names to expand details
- **Responsive design** - Works on mobile and desktop
- **Auto date** - Footer shows current month/year

## Tech used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (flexbox, animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Font Awesome icons
- Google Fonts (Lato)

## The flashlight thing

The main feature is a "flashlight" effect where the page goes dark and you get a circle of light following your cursor. It's just CSS `radial-gradient` with JavaScript mouse tracking.

## Structure

- Basic sections: Skills, Work Experience, Education, Summary, Projects
- Skills have sliding animations (left/right)
- Projects use accordion dropdowns
- Contact info in footer

## Why I made it

Wanted to practice JavaScript DOM manipulation and try something different from a regular PDF resume. The flashlight effect was just for fun.

Nothing fancy, just a web-based CV with some interactive elements.
